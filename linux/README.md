I think the content of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UOdYxKW8pE) is good, but the quality
of the video itself is awful. The creator also references a post they wrote - https://lewboski.dev/blog/linux-kernel.

From a quick glance of the blog post, looks like you could skip the video entirely and read the post instead.
