# The most important built-in function is derivation, which is used to describe
# a single store-layer store derivation. Consult the store chapter for what a store
# derivation is; this section just concerns how to create one from the Nix language.

# A derivation, upon evaluation, creates an immutable .drv file in the Nix store
# (typically located at /nix/store) named by the hash of the derivationâ€™s inputs.
# A separate step, called realisation, ensures that the outputs of the derivation's
# builder program are available as an immutable directory in the Nix store, either
# by running the builder program or downloading the results of a previous run from a cache.
